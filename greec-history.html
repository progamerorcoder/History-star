    <h4>Periods    </h4>
    <p>Historians often divide up the history of ancient Greece into three periods:</p>

<div>
    <h4>Archaic Period</h4>
    <p>This period ran from the start of Greek civilization in 800 BC to the introduction of Democracy in 508 BC. This period included the start of the Olympic Games and Homer's writing of the Odyssey and the Illiad.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Classical Period </h4>
    <p>This is the time that many of us think of when we think of ancient Greece. Athens was governed by a democracy and great philosophers like Socrates and Plato arose. Also, the wars between Sparta and Athens were during this time. This period ended with the rise and then the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Hellenistic Period</h4>
    <p>The Hellenistic period lasted from the death of Alexander the Great until 31 BC when Rome defeated Egypt at the Battle of Actium. The name Hellenistic comes from the Greek word "Hellas", which is the original word for Greece.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Athens and Sparta
    </h4>
    <p>Athens and Sparta were the two main city states that ruled much of ancient Greece. They were often rivals and fought each other in the Peloponnesian Wars. At other times they united together in order to protect the Greek lands from invaders. The cultures of the two cities were very different. Sparta was almost entirely focused on war and how to fight, while Athens focused on the arts and learning.</p>
